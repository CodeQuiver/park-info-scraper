# park-info-scraper

# Description
This app will scrape information on upcoming events and important announcements from the Arlington County Parks and Recreation website so that all event information will be available on a single page (details will be viewable in a collapsed area under each heading) rather than clicking around the complex park service site. It will also allow readers to leave comments on the event postings as well as view and delete previous comments. This doesn't include a login feature or anything to restrict which comments can be deleted, though that would be added in a real-world version of this app.

If time allows, or as a future expansion to this, I would like to add at-a-glance listings for each park location with hours, contact info and address, facilities, fees, and all current class offerings if any at that location. This would be more convenient than the current search system on their website for users who simply want an overview of offerings rather than having to use the search features or page through the full pdf document listing all classes system-wide online. 

# Context
This is a homework assignment from my Web Development bootcamp course to use MongoDB, MongoJS, mongoose, cheerio, request, express, body-parser, and handlebars to create a full-stack web scraper application.
